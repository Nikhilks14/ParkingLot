**Problem Statement**

**Scenario**

You're building the backend system for a parking lot management solution. The system must support the following requirements:

- **Multiple vehicle types**: Such as motorcycles, cars, and trucks.
- **Spot allocation**: Assign vehicles to available parking spots based on their type.
- **Ticketing system**: Generate a ticket upon entry, recording vehicle info, time, and spot.
- **Exit and payment**: When a vehicle exits, the system should calculate the fee based on parking duration and vehicle type, and process the payment.
- **Dynamic pricing**: Pricing may vary depending on the duration or type of vehicle.
- **Availability tracking**: Monitor and update the availability status of parking spots.

This system should aim for simplicity and reliability while being extensible for features like reservations, automated license plate recognition, or tiered membership plans.

**Question**

Design a parking lot system that supports vehicle entry and exit, generates tickets, calculates fees dynamically based on vehicle type and parking duration, and tracks spot availability.
